to Executives Summary">​</a></h2><p align="justify">Sao Viet, a reputable educational organization specializing in providing training courses in office computing, rapid computing, Excel, AutoCAD, and SolidWorks for working individuals, is facing some management-related issues that are affecting the center&#x27;s business efficiency.</p><p align="justify">Firstly, the center&#x27;s student management system is not modern, as it still uses <b>Excel and Google Sheets</b> to manage student information, courses, and other activities. This approach not only wastes time and effort but also does not guarantee the accuracy and synchronization of data. In addition, revenue and expenditure calculations are still <b>performed manually</b>, leading to difficulties in controlling and monitoring revenue, expenses, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of courses. At the same time, communication between departments such as administration, teachers, and accountants is <b>weak</b>, and information is <b>not effectively shared</b>. The consequence is that the center&#x27;s overall management is facing many difficulties, reducing its effectiveness and synchronization.</p><p align="justify">To improve the situation, the following solutions should be implemented to build the Sao Viet student management portal: developing an online student management system to help the center easily track and update student information, course schedules, attendance, grades, and other activities quickly and accurately; integrating automated revenue and expenditure management functions to help the center easily track revenue, expenses, and evaluate the effectiveness of courses, improve communication between departments and ensure information is shared effectively. Implementing these solutions will help the center improve its management effectiveness, improve the quality of training and student support services, and meet the center&#x27;s operating needs in today&#x27;s digital age.</p><p align="justify">Specifically, in the new online student management system, the center will have easier access to and update student information quickly and accurately. This will minimize errors and help the center have a more comprehensive view of its operations. Moreover, integrating automated revenue and expenditure management functions will help the center have better control over revenue, expenses, and the effectiveness of courses, from which appropriate business strategies can be developed.</p><p align="justify">In addition, improving communication between departments will ensure that information is shared effectively, contributing to improving synchronization and effectiveness in the center&#x27;s overall management. At the same time, the center should also invest in updating its infrastructure and staff training to support the new system effectively.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="feasibility-of-the-problem">Feasibility of the problem<a href="#feasibility-of-the-problem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Feasibility of the problem" title="Direct link to Feasibility of the problem">​</a></h2><p align="justify">Based on the survey of the current situation, we see that establishing a Sao Viet student management portal can feasibly address the following issues:</p><div align="justify"><ul><li>Building an online student management system that allows the center to easily track and update student information, courses, schedules, attendance, grades, and other activities. This system will replace Excel and Google Sheets, increase automation and synchronization in management work.</li><li>In the new student management system, integrating automatic revenue and expense management functions will help the center easily track revenue, expenses, and accurately and quickly evaluate the effectiveness of courses.</li><li>Developing an efficient internal communication tool that helps departments in the center easily exchange information, share data, and support each other in management work. This will ensure consistency in management among departments and improve overall center efficiency.</li><li>To ensure the effective application of the new student management system, it is necessary to organize training and guide employees and lecturers on how to use the system, helping them understand the functions, and work processes.</li></ul></div><p align="justify">Building the Sao Viet student management portal will help the center improve the efficiency of management work while improving the quality of training and student support services. This is an important step in meeting the operational needs of the center.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="target-users">Target Users<a href="#target-users" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Target Users" title="Direct link to Target Users">​</a></h2><p align="justify">The center is facing some management-related issues and proposes to build a modern management system that meets the center&#x27;s requirements. The personnel structure at Sao Viet includes:</p><div align="justify"><ul><li><b>Board of Directors</b>: This department makes decisions and develops strategies for the center, monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of other departments.</li><li><b>Accounting Department</b>: Responsible for managing finances, income/expense, preparing financial reports, and controlling the center&#x27;s costs.</li><li><b>Teaching Department</b>: Comprised of specialized instructors who teach, create exam papers, grade exams, and evaluate the quality of student training.</li><li><b>Student Department</b>: Composed of students who are studying at the center, participating in courses, and activities organized by the center.</li><li><b>Marketing Department</b>: Responsible for marketing and promoting the center&#x27;s image, attracting new students, and increasing revenue for the center.</li></ul></div><p align="justify">With the above personnel structure, Sao Viet needs to build a modern management system to improve management efficiency, as well as enhance the quality of training and support services for students. The new management system needs to integrate functions to manage students, teachers, accounting, marketing, as well as reporting and statistics, helping departments operate synchronously and more effectively.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="business-context">Business Context<a href="#business-context" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Business Context" title="Direct link to Business Context">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="course-registration-process">Course registration process<a href="#course-registration-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Course registration process" title="Direct link to Course registration process">​</a></h3><p align="justify">The registration process for a course at Sao Viet Training Center is convenient and flexible for students and includes various communication channels. The registration process begins when students contact the center through various communication channels such as the fan page, Zalo, hotline, email, or directly at the center. The center&#x27;s staff receives the registration request, collects the student&#x27;s personal information, including name, email, gender, phone number, address, place of birth, date of birth, and occupation information, and stores them in the center&#x27;s database. All personal information of the student is encoded and secured to ensure safety and security.</p><p align="justify">Before registering, students can refer to information about the courses provided by the center to choose the one that suits their learning needs. When deciding to register, students will complete the process by finalizing the registration and paying the tuition fee. The center will provide students with detailed information about the class schedule, the teacher in charge, the course content, and other related information for the student to prepare best for the learning process. Students can request to reserve a seat in the course for a certain period if they want to think or refer more.</p><p align="justify">Each course has detailed information, including the course code, course name, and description. Additionally, each course is organized in many different branches, with many diverse classes and tuition fees, making it easy for students to choose the course that suits their conditions and needs.</p><p align="justify">After each class at the center, students need to update information about the lesson content to keep track of their learning progress. The information that needs to be updated includes the lesson name, lesson content, study date, teacher, and course evaluation. The system will automatically save the status of absence or exemption for those who already have knowledge of the content before. To ensure transparency and help manage the center&#x27;s finances accurately and effectively, each student will be given a payment voucher when registering for a course. The tuition payment voucher will state specific information such as voucher code, payment date, amount, and payment method to help students easily make the tuition payment. If there is a discount program for the tuition fee, according to the agreement, the Sao Viet Training Center will provide students with relevant information, including the discount rate, conditions, and duration. Students can refer to and choose the appropriate program for their needs. In the tuition payment voucher, the center will also indicate the deadline for students to make tuition payments to avoid cancellation of their registration.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="employee-management-process">Employee Management Process<a href="#employee-management-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Employee Management Process" title="Direct link to Employee Management Process">​</a></h3><p align="justify">The employee management process at the center includes keeping detailed personal information of each employee such as a unique identification code, full name, date and place of birth, gender, and start date for tracking their work time at the center. Employees are differentiated by their job title through a job code and name, which helps to determine their role and responsibilities within the organization.</p><p align="justify">Teachers are responsible for teaching classes and managing their students. They need to prepare lesson plans, organize teaching, evaluate and assess the learning outcomes of their students. Teachers also need to monitor the progress of their students, help and answer questions, and update lesson information and learning outcomes of students on the center&#x27;s management system.</p><p align="justify">Branch managers are responsible for the overall operation of their branch, including managing all classes, students, teachers, and staff. They need to develop a plan for the branch&#x27;s development, allocate resources, control the budget, and monitor business targets. Branch managers also need to ensure that the quality of education and service provided meets the center&#x27;s standards. Branch managers have access to and can edit student information within their branch. They need to receive and process requests and feedback from students and parents, as well as resolve issues that arise during students&#x27; learning process.</p><p align="justify">In addition, branch managers are responsible for registering accounts for students when they come to register for classes at the center. They will collect necessary information, create accounts, and grant access to the system so that students can track their learning progress and communicate with teachers. Branch managers also have the right to edit their own and students&#x27; account information when necessary, ensuring that information is always accurate and up-to-date.</p><p align="justify">Branch managers need to work closely with other teachers and staff in the branch to organize extracurricular activities, events, and additional training programs to enhance students&#x27; skills and learning experiences. They also need to monitor and update the learning status of students, evaluate the quality of training, support students in their learning process, and absorb feedback from students, parents, and the teaching team to improve the center&#x27;s teaching and services.</p><p align="justify">Branch managers play an important role in monitoring and ensuring the quality of education provided by the center. They are responsible for building and implementing policies, regulations, and procedures that create a professional and effective working environment for employees. Additionally, they need to identify and solve problems that arise and maintain good relationships with students, parents, and employees.</p><p align="justify">In addition to the responsibilities outlined above, the employee management process at the center also involves tracking employee attendance and performance. This includes monitoring the number of classes taught by each teacher, the quality of their teaching, and their overall contribution to the center&#x27;s success.</p><p align="justify">To ensure that employees are meeting the center&#x27;s expectations, regular evaluations and feedback sessions are conducted. This allows managers to provide constructive criticism and support to their staff, while also identifying areas for improvement. It also provides employees with the opportunity to voice any concerns they may have and receive guidance on how to address them.</p><p align="justify">Another important aspect of employee management is training and development. The center offers various training programs to help employees improve their skills and stay up-to-date with the latest teaching techniques and technologies. Managers work with employees to identify their individual training needs and develop plans to address them.</p><p align="justify">Overall, effective employee management is essential for the success of any organization, and the center&#x27;s management team takes this responsibility seriously. By providing a supportive work environment, offering opportunities for professional development, and monitoring employee performance, the center is able to attract and retain talented and dedicated employees who are committed to delivering high-quality education services to students.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="branch-management-process">Branch management process<a href="#branch-management-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Branch management process" title="Direct link to Branch management process">​</a></h3><p align="justify">In the management system of the training center, the director plays a crucial role in monitoring, directing, and guiding the development of all activities of the center, including its branches. The director is equipped with detailed functions to ensure the effective operation of the center.</p><p align="justify">The director has access to information on the entire system, including the list of classes, students, income and expenses at each branch, teaching performance statistics of teachers, and evaluation of training quality. With this information, the director has an overview of the center&#x27;s activities and can make appropriate strategies and decisions for the center&#x27;s development. Additionally, the director is responsible for verifying and confirming the issuance of certificates to students who have completed their courses. They must ensure that students meet the standard criteria, evaluate their learning results, and approve certificate issuance requests from teachers before issuing certificates.</p><p align="justify">The director can filter student information according to various criteria such as courses, branches, scores, registration time, and export data to Excel files for easy printing of certificates, statistics, analysis, and reporting. The director can also control the printing of certificates for students by turning this function on or off, ensuring that only qualified students receive certificates and avoiding duplicate printing or printing certificates for students who do not meet the requirements. In addition, the director is responsible for creating accounts and granting permissions to employees within the system.
