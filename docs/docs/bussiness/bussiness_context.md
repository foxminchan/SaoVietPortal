# Business Scenario

## Executives Summary

<p align="justify">
Sao Viet, a reputable educational organization specializing in providing training courses in office computing, rapid computing, Excel, AutoCAD, and SolidWorks for working individuals, is facing some management-related issues that are affecting the center's business efficiency.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Firstly, the center's student management system is not modern, as it still uses <b>Excel and Google Sheets</b> to manage student information, courses, and other activities. This approach not only wastes time and effort but also does not guarantee the accuracy and synchronization of data. In addition, revenue and expenditure calculations are still <b>performed manually</b>, leading to difficulties in controlling and monitoring revenue, expenses, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of courses. At the same time, communication between departments such as administration, teachers, and accountants is <b>weak</b>, and information is <b>not effectively shared</b>. The consequence is that the center's overall management is facing many difficulties, reducing its effectiveness and synchronization.
</p>

<p align="justify">
To improve the situation, the following solutions should be implemented to build the Sao Viet student management portal: developing an online student management system to help the center easily track and update student information, course schedules, attendance, grades, and other activities quickly and accurately; integrating automated revenue and expenditure management functions to help the center easily track revenue, expenses, and evaluate the effectiveness of courses, improve communication between departments and ensure information is shared effectively. Implementing these solutions will help the center improve its management effectiveness, improve the quality of training and student support services, and meet the center's operating needs in today's digital age.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Specifically, in the new online student management system, the center will have easier access to and update student information quickly and accurately. This will minimize errors and help the center have a more comprehensive view of its operations. Moreover, integrating automated revenue and expenditure management functions will help the center have better control over revenue, expenses, and the effectiveness of courses, from which appropriate business strategies can be developed.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In addition, improving communication between departments will ensure that information is shared effectively, contributing to improving synchronization and effectiveness in the center's overall management. At the same time, the center should also invest in updating its infrastructure and staff training to support the new system effectively.
</p>

## Feasibility of the problem

<p align="justify">
Based on the survey of the current situation, we see that establishing a Sao Viet student management portal can feasibly address the following issues:
</p>

    </li>
    <li>
        In the new student management system, integrating automatic revenue and expense management functions will help the center easily track revenue, expenses, and accurately and quickly evaluate the effectiveness of courses.
    </li>
    <li>
        Developing an efficient internal communication tool that helps departments in the center easily exchange information, share data, and support each other in management work. This will ensure consistency in management among departments and improve overall center efficiency.
    </li>
    <li>
        To ensure the effective application of the new student management system, it is necessary to organize training and guide employees and lecturers on how to use the system, helping them understand the functions, and work processes.

</div>

<p align="justify">
Building the Sao Viet student management portal will help the center improve the efficiency of management work while improving the quality of training and student support services. This is an important step in meeting the operational needs of the center.
</p>

## Target Users

<p align="justify">
The center is facing some management-related issues and proposes to build a modern management system that meets the center's requirements. The personnel structure at Sao Viet includes:

        <b>Board of Directors</b>: This department makes decisions and develops strategies for the center, monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of other departments.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Accounting Department</b>: Responsible for managing finances, income/expense, preparing financial reports, and controlling the center's costs.

</p>

## Business Context

### Course registration process

<p align="justify">
The registration process for a course at Sao Viet Training Center is convenient and flexible for students and includes various communication channels. The registration process begins when students contact the center through various communication channels such as the fan page, Zalo, hotline, email, or directly at the center. The center's staff receives the registration request, collects the student's personal information, including name, email, gender, phone number, address, place of birth, date of birth, and occupation information, and stores them in the center's database. All personal information of the student is encoded and secured to ensure safety and security.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Before registering, students can refer to information about the courses provided by the center to choose the one that suits their learning needs. When deciding to register, students will complete the process by finalizing the registration and paying the tuition fee. The center will provide students with detailed information about the class schedule, the teacher in charge, the course content, and other related information for the student to prepare best for the learning process. Students can request to reserve a seat in the course for a certain period if they want to think or refer more.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Each course has detailed information, including the course code, course name, and description. Additionally, each course is organized in many different branches, with many diverse classes and tuition fees, making it easy for students to choose the course that suits their conditions and needs.
</p>

<p align="justify">
After each class at the center, students need to update information about the lesson content to keep track of their learning progress. The information that needs to be updated includes the lesson name, lesson content, study date, teacher, and course evaluation. The system will automatically save the status of absence or exemption for those who already have knowledge of the content before. To ensure transparency and help manage the center's finances accurately and effectively, each student will be given a payment voucher when registering for a course. The tuition payment voucher will state specific information such as voucher code, payment date, amount, and payment method to help students easily make the tuition payment. If there is a discount program for the tuition fee, according to the agreement, the Sao Viet Training Center will provide students with relevant information, including the discount rate, conditions, and duration. Students can refer to and choose the appropriate program for their needs. In the tuition payment voucher, the center will also indicate the deadline for students to make tuition payments to avoid cancellation of their registration.
</p>

### Employee Management Process

<p align="justify">
The employee management process at the center includes keeping detailed personal information of each employee such as a unique identification code, full name, date and place of birth, gender, and start date for tracking their work time at the center.

Branch managers are responsible for the overall operation of their branch, including managing all classes, students, teachers, and staff.

Branch managers also have the right to edit their own and students' account information when necessary, ensuring that information is always accurate and up-to-date.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Branch managers need to work closely with other teachers and staff in the branch to organize extracurricular activities, events, and additional training programs to enhance students' skills and learning experiences.

This includes monitoring the number of classes taught by each teacher, the quality of their teaching, and their overall contribution to the center's success.
</p>

<p align="justify">
To ensure that employees are meeting the center's expectations, regular evaluations and feedback sessions are conducted. This allows managers to provide constructive criticism and support to their staff, while also identifying areas for improvement. It also provides employees with the opportunity to voice any concerns they may have and receive guidance on how to address them.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Another important aspect of employee management is training and development. The center offers various training programs to help employees improve their skills and stay up-to-date with the latest teaching techniques and technologies.

Overall, effective employee management is essential for the success of any organization, and the center's management team takes this responsibility seriously.
