# Architecture

<p style="text-align: justify">
The architecture of the application is designed to be highly scalable and flexible, which means that it can handle a large number of users and can easily adapt to changing needs and requirements. The following diagram shows the high-level components of the architecture:
</p>

<img src="./resources/Assets/img/overview-architecture.png" style="align: center;">

It showcases the following components:

- **Client**: The client includes the web application, desktop application, and mobile application.
- **BFF**: The BFF is a backend for frontend, which is responsible for handling the client's requests and forwarding them to the API.
- **API Services**: The API services are responsible for handling the requests from the BFF and the database.
- **OpenTelemetry Collector**: The OpenTelemetry Collector is responsible for collecting and processing telemetry data from the API services and the database.
- **External Services**: The external services are responsible for handling the requests from the API services and the database.

- [Install MS SQL Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/download) (If you want run without docker)

üê≥ In addition, you can set up the enviroment in container using docker:

> First, you need to pull the image named .net core 7.0 sdk from docker hub
>
> ```bash
> docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0
> ```
>
> Set up the SQL Server 2022
>
> ```bash
> docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "SA_PASSWORD=Password123" -p 1433:1433 --name sql1 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
> ```
>
> Set up the Redis
>
> ```bash
> docker run -p 6379:6379 --name redis -d redis
> ```
>
> Run the command to start the application
>
> ```bash
> docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/app -w /app mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 dotnet run --project api/portal/src/Portal.Api/Portal.Api.csproj
> ```
>
> **Note**: You can use the command `docker ps` to check the status of the container

For the database:

1. Install the **dotnet ef** tool: `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`
2. Navigate to the `api/portal/src/Portal.Infrastructure` folder.
   - Clean up old migrations: `dotnet ef migrations remove --project Portal.Infrastructure.csproj --startup-project Portal.Api.csproj --force`
   - Create a new migration: `dotnet ef migrations add Initial --project Portal.Infrastructure.csproj --startup-project Portal.Api.csproj`
   - Update the database: `dotnet ef database update --project Portal.Infrastructure.csproj --startup-project Portal.Api.csproj`
3. Learn more about [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/).

**‚ö†Ô∏èNote**: You can use backup files to restore the database. The backup files are located in the `api/portal/database` folder.

For JWT generation:

To initialize the keys for JWT generation, run `dotnet user-jwts` in to the `api/portal/src/Portal.Api` folder.

```bash
dotnet user-jwts create --claim "Technical=Developer"
```

Set up external services:

1. Navigate to the `api/portal/deploys/docker` folder.
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the external services.

Install Tye for global tool using the following command:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.Tye
```

Run `tye run` in the repository root and navigate to the tye dashboard (usually http://localhost:8000) to see both applications running.
